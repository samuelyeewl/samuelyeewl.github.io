I'm currently a first-year graduate student in the [Department of Astrophysical Sciences](https://www.astro.princeton.edu) at Princeton University. Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu), majoring in Physics with a minor in Planetary Science.

I study exoplanets and the stars they orbit. Just over twenty years ago, we didn't know of any planets apart from the (at the time) nine in our Solar System. In the years since, we have discovered thousands of exoplanets, many of which are in planetary systems that look nothing like our own, ranging from [hot Jupiters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Jupiter), compact multiplanet systems like [TRAPPIST-1](http://www.trappist.one/), and misaligned systems such as [HAT-P-11](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09352) - which was the focus of one of my [recent projects]({{ '/research/' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}).

With missions such as the recently-launched [TESS](https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov/) and the upcoming [James Webb Space Telescope](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/), we'll be able to not just discover more such systems, but also to examine them in detail. I believe our discoveries of these alien worlds represent a true revolution in understanding our place in the cosmos and how we got here.

I was born and grew up in sunny Singapore, a cosmopolitan and urban city-state with some of the most diverse food in the world. Home is the constant bustle and bright lights of the city, the smoke of a barbecue on the beach, the cacophony of sounds at a hawker centre. But since moving to the United States, I've come to appreciate the value in taking a quiet moment out in nature, experiencing the vast opennness, fresh air, and starry night skies.
