Testing.

I'm currently an undergraduate in Physics and Planetary Sciences at the [California Institute of Technology](http://www.caltech.edu/). I am interested in exoplanet astronomy and have had the opportunity to work on some [research projects]({{ '/research/' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}).

I was born and grew up in sunny Singapore, a cosmopolitan and urban country. When I came to California, I was amazed by the incredible nature all around - mountains, beaches, canyons, deserts. I love going hiking, to experience the vast openness, fresh air, and starry night skies. I also enjoy traveling to different parts of the world, catching a glimpse of different cultures.
