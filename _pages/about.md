I'm currently a final year graduate student in the [Department of Astrophysical Sciences](https://www.astro.princeton.edu) at Princeton University, working with [Josh Winn](https://web.astro.princeton.edu/people/joshua-winn). I plan to defend my PhD in August 2023 and will begin as a [51 Pegasi b Fellow](https://hsfoundation.org/programs/science/51-pegasi-b-fellowship) at the [Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://cfa.harvard.edu) in September 2023.

My research interests are in understanding Hot Jupiters -- giant planets like Jupiter in our own solar system, but which orbit much closer to their stars, taking just a few days to make a complete orbit.
In comparison, Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun in our solar system, takes 88 days to go around once.
So these planets are among the hottest worlds in the universe!
These extreme planets have many peculiarities, with many having "inflated radii" -- appearing larger than we would expect from their masses, as well as having strong winds that blow around the planet at many hundreds of miles per hour.
Recently, we even found that the planet [WASP-12b](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09131) has an orbit that is decaying, and will crash into its star in just a few million years.

Hot Jupiters were the first kind of exoplanet to be found, with the discovery of 51 Peg b (for which the discoverers were awarded the [Nobel Prize in Physics in 2019](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2019/summary/)).
They came as a surprise to most astronomers, as it was thought that no planet could form so close to its star.
More than two decades later, how exactly these planets came to be remains a mystery.
It's likely that they formed further out and migrated inward, but we would like to understand how exactly they did so.

The goal of my PhD thesis is to build up a census of the closest hot Jupiters, so that we have a large population we can study the demographics of.
Although hot Jupiters are relatively easy to find, due to their large mass and short orbits, it turns out they are pretty rare, occurring around less than 1% of stars.
Fortunately, NASA's [TESS](https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov/) mission is conducting an all-sky search for transiting planets, and we expect that it will find hundreds of new hot Jupiters.
I am using a variety of telescopes around the world to follow up and confirm the existence of these giant planets, hoping to discover the hundreds of objects we need to understand the population as a whole.

Stay tuned for updates!

Before coming to Princeton, I completed my undergraduate studies at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu), majoring in Physics with a minor in Planetary Science. Even before that, I was born and grew up in sunny Singapore, a cosmopolitan and urban city-state with some of the most diverse food in the world. Home is the constant bustle and bright lights of the city, the smoke of a barbecue on the beach, the cacophony of sounds at a hawker centre. But since moving to the United States, I've also come to appreciate the value in taking a quiet moment out in nature, experiencing the vast opennness, fresh air, and starry night skies.
