One of the major insights from the thousands of exoplanets we have discovered in the last two decades has been that exoplanetary systems often have very different architectures from our own Solar System. For example, HAT-P-11b - the first transiting hot Neptune discovered ([Bakos et al. 2009](https://arxiv.org/abs/0901.0282)), is on a highly inclined orbit that takes it over the poles of its host star. In contrast, the planets in our Solar System orbit in roughly the same plane, with their orbital axes aligned with the Sun's spin axis to within six degrees. The large spin-orbit misalignment for HAT-P-11b is particularly unusual because it orbits a relatively cool star.

Using the decade-long radial velocity dataset for HAT-P-11 obtained by the California Planet Search team, I discovered a new planet, HAT-P-11c, orbiting with a period of ~ nine years. Together with [Konstantin Batygin](https://www.konstantinbatygin.com/), we found that the presence of this outer planet could help explain the high inclination of the inner planet's orbit by inducing nodal precession. 

Understanding the origin of spin-orbit misalignments - whether they come from primordial misalignment of the protoplanetary disk, high-eccentricity migration, or dynamical interactions between planets - can in turn help us understand the formation pathways of close-in planets.
