Over the last year, I worked with [Erik Petigura](https://petigura.github.io/) on a new tool for characterizing stars based on their spectra, by comparing them to a library of high resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra. The library comprises previously well-characterized stars, and we synthesise combinations of these library spectra to best match the target. We found this algorithm to be highly robust, working particularly well with late-type stars which have a wealth of information in their spectra. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/samuelyeewl/specmatch-emp/), and documentation [here](http://specmatch-emp.readthedocs.io).
