imgcaption: TESS presents an opportunity to assemble a complete, magnitude-limited sample of 400 hot Jupiters orbiting FGK stars brighter than G = 12.5 mag. Of these, 150 were previously known from ground-based surveys, while the remainder will be new detections from TESS. My survey has confirmed > 70 new hot Jupiters to build up this sample.

Hot Jupiters -- giant planets that orbit their stars in less than ten days -- were the first exoplanets to be found. Today, we know of hundreds of them, and some individual planets have been studied in great detail, including atmospheric characterization by _JWST_ (e.g. [WASP-39b](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2022/nasa-s-webb-detects-carbon-dioxide-in-exoplanet-atmosphere/)). The discovery of such large planets so close in to their stars came as a surprise to astronomers, and three decades later, we still do not have a good idea of how they formed.

Most of the currently known hot Jupiters were discovered by various ground-based surveys, such as [HAT](http://hatsurveys.org/) and [WASP](https://wasp-planets.net/). Each of these surveys had different selection criteria and biases, which has made combining their discoveries into a single sample difficult. Hot Jupiters are also relatively rare, occurring around only 1% or less of Sun-like stars. This meant that [NASA's _Kepler_ mission](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/overview/index.html) discovered only 40 such planets. As a result, it has been challenging to study hot Jupiters as a population.

[NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission](https://www.nasa.gov/tess-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite) is searching stars across the entire sky for planets. This means that it will "re-discover" all of the previously known hot Jupiters as well as find new ones. We now have the opportunity to create a homogeneous sample of hot Jupiters to study their demographics. I forecast that we would be able to create a sample of 400 hot Jupiters by searching stars brighter than G < 12.5 mag ([Yee, Winn & Hartman (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12376)).

For my PhD thesis, I have been conducting the TESS Grand Unified Hot Jupiter Survey in order to confirm and characterize the new hot Jupiter candidates discovered by TESS and thereby create this demographic sample. I work with members of the [TESS Follow-up Observing Program](https://tess.mit.edu/followup/) to obtain photometric, spectroscopic and imaging observations to rule out false positives. I then use high-precision spectrographs including Keck/HIRES, Magellan/PFS, and WIYN/NEID to measure the masses of these planets.

Over the past year and a half, I have observed more than 150 planet candidates from TESS, of which at least 70 have turned out to be real planets, with the first 30 published in [Yee et al. (2022a)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09728), [Yee et al. (2022b)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15473). In collaboration with other members of the community, we expect to complete our survey in 2023 and have assembled the largest ever statistical sample of hot Jupiters. Stay tuned for the demographic results that will arise from this work!
