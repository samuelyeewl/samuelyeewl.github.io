    <p>TOI-3884 b is an unusual 6.4 R_⊕planet orbiting
        an M4 host, whose transits display large and persistent spot-
        crossing events. We used the Tierras Observatory to monitor both
        the long-term photometric variability of TOI-3884 and changes in
        the spot-crossing events across multiple transits of the planet.
        We show that the star rotates with a period of 11.020
        \pm 0.015 days. We simultaneously model the
        rotational modulation of the star and variations in transit
        shapes that arise due to rotation of the spot, allowing us to
        determine the true stellar obliquity,
        \psi_⋆. The data are best
        described by a planet on a misaligned orbit around a highly
        inclined star (\psi_⋆= 77.4_-2.5^+2.3^∘;
        i_⋆= 22.3_-1.6^+1.8^∘) that hosts
        a large polar starspot (r_\mathrmspot = 31.2_-1.9^+2.4^∘;
        \lambda_\mathrmspot = 70.5^∘ \pm 1.2^∘).
        Archival photometry from
        the Zwicky Transient Facility suggests that this polar spot has
        persisted on TOI-3884 for at least seven years. The TOI-3884
        system provides a benchmark for studying the evolution of a
        polar spot on an M dwarf.</p>

    <p>The “Neptunian ridge“ is a recently identified peak in the frequency
        of planets with sizes between that of Neptune and Saturn
        orbiting their host stars with periods between 3 and 6 days (A.
        Castro-González et al. 2024). These planets may have formed
        similarly to their larger, hot Jupiter counterparts in the
        “three-day pile-up”, through a dynamically excited migration
        pathway. The distribution of stellar obliquities in hot Neptune
        systems may therefore provide a vital clue as to their origin.
        We report a new stellar obliquity measurement for
        TOI-2374 b, a planet in the Neptunian ridge (P =
        4.31 days, R_p = 7.5 R_⊕). We observed a spectroscopic
        transit of TOI-2374 b with the Keck Planet Finder, detecting the
        Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) anomaly with an amplitude of 3 m/s, and
        measured a sky-projected obliquity of λ=
        81^∘^+23^∘_-22^∘, indicating an orbit
        significantly misaligned with the spin axis of its host star. A
        reloaded RM analysis of the cross-correlation functions confirms
        this misalignment, measuring λ=
        65^∘^+32^∘_-24^∘. Additionally, we measured a
        stellar rotation period of P_\mathrmrot = 26.4^+0.9_-0.8
        days with photometry from the Tierras observatory, allowing us
        to deduce the three-dimensional stellar obliquity of ψ=
        85.9^∘^+8.6^∘_-9.2^∘. TOI-2374 b joins a
        growing number of hot Neptunes on polar orbits. The high
        frequency of misaligned orbits for Neptunian ridge and desert
        planets, compared with their longer period counterparts, is
        reminiscent of patterns seen for the giant planets and may
        suggest a similar formation mechanism.</p>

    <p>We present the discovery of 30 transiting giant planets that were
        initially detected using data from NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet
        Survey Satellite mission. These new planets orbit relatively
        bright (G \ensuremath≤ 12.5) FGK host stars with orbital
        periods between 1.6 and 8.2 days, and have radii between 0.9 and
        1.7 Jupiter radii. We performed follow-up ground-based
        photometry, high angular resolution imaging, high-resolution
        spectroscopy, and radial velocity monitoring for each of these
        objects to confirm that they are planets and determine their
        masses and other system parameters. The planets’ masses span
        more than an order of magnitude (0.17 M_J &lt; M_p &lt; 3.3
        M_J). For two planets, TOI-3593 b and TOI-4961 b, we
        measured significant nonzero eccentricities of 0.11‑0.03+0.05
        and 0.18‑0.05+0.04 , respectively, while for the other planets,
        the data typically provide a 1\ensuremathσ upper bound
        of 0.15 on the eccentricity. These discoveries represent a major
        step toward assembling a complete, magnitude-limited sample of
        transiting hot Jupiters around FGK stars. *This paper includes
        data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las
        Campanas Observatory, Chile.</p>

    <p>We measure the true obliquity of TOI-2364, a K dwarf with a sub-Saturn-
        mass (M_p = 0.18 M_J) transiting planet on the upper
        edge of the hot-Neptune desert. We used new
        Rossiter–McLaughlin observations gathered with the
        Keck Planet Finder to measure the sky-projected obliquity
        \ensuremathλ = 7\textdegree +
        10\textdegree–11\textdegree. Combined with a
        stellar rotation period of 23.47 \ensuremath\pm 0.29 days
        measured with photometry from the Tierras Observatory, this
        yields a stellar inclination of 90\textdegree
        \ensuremath\pm 13\textdegree and a true obliquity
        \ensuremathψ = 15.\textdegree6 +
        7.\textdegree7–7.\textdegree3, indicating that
        the planet’s orbit is well aligned with the rotation axis of its
        host star. The determination of \ensuremathψ is important
        for investigating a potential bimodality in the orbits of short-
        period sub-Saturns around cool stars, which tend to be either
        aligned with or perpendicular to their host stars’ spin axes.</p>

    <p>The “super-puffs” are a population of planets that have masses
        comparable to that of Neptune but radii similar to Jupiter,
        leading to extremely low bulk densities
        (\ensuremathρ_p \ensuremath≲ 0.2 g
        cm^‑3) that are not easily explained by standard core
        accretion models. Interestingly, several of these super-puffs
        are found in orbits significantly misaligned with their host
        stars’ spin axes, indicating past dynamical excitation that may
        be connected to their low densities. Here, we present new
        Magellan/Planet Finder Spectrograph radial velocity measurements
        of WASP-193, a late F star hosting one of the least dense
        transiting planets known to date (, , \ensuremathρ_p
        = 0.060 \ensuremath\pm 0.019 g cm^‑3). We refine the
        bulk properties of WASP-193 b and use interior structure models
        to determine that the planet can be explained if it consists of
        roughly equal amounts of metals and H/He, with a metal fraction
        of Z = 0.42. The planet is likely substantially reinflated due
        to its host star’s evolution, and expected to be actively
        undergoing mass loss. We also measure the projected stellar
        obliquity using the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect,
        finding that WASP-193 b is on an orbit well aligned with the
        stellar equator, with  degrees. WASP-193 b is the first Jupiter-
        sized super-puff on a relatively well-aligned orbit, suggesting
        a diversity of formation pathways for this population of
        planets. ^*This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5

    <p>TOI-2818 b is a hot Jupiter orbiting a slightly evolved G-type star on a
        4.04 day orbit that shows transit timing variations (TTVs)
        suggestive of a decreasing orbital period. In the most recent
        year of TESS observations, transits were observed
        \ensuremath∼8 minutes earlier than expected for a
        constant period. The implied orbital decay rate is 1.35
        \ensuremath\pm 0.25 s yr^‑1, too fast to be explained by
        tidal dissipation, even considering the evolved nature of the
        host star. Radial velocity (RV) monitoring and astrometric data
        make the possibility of perturbations from a long-period
        companion unlikely; further Doppler spectroscopy observations
        can efficiently confirm or rule out such a companion. Apsidal
        precession due to the tidal distortion of the planet is also
        physically implausible. The most plausible explanation for the
        TTVs appears to be gravitational perturbations from a hitherto
        undetected planet with mass \ensuremath≲10
        M_\ensuremath⊕ that is in (or near) a mean-motion
        resonance with the hot Jupiter. Such a planet could be
        responsible for the observed TTVs while avoiding detection with
        the available RV and transit data.</p>

    <p>In 2010, Bakos and collaborators discovered a Neptune-sized planet
        transiting the K-dwarf HAT-P-11 every five days. Later in 2018,
        Yee and collaborators reported an additional Jovian-mass
        companion on a nine year orbit based on a decade of Doppler
        monitoring. The eccentric outer giant HAT-P-11c may be
        responsible for the peculiar polar orbit of the inner planet
        HAT-P-11b. However, Basilicata et al. recently suggested that
        the HAT-P-11c Doppler signal could be caused by stellar
        activity. In this research note, we extend the Yee et al.
        Doppler time series by six years. The combined data set spanning
        17 yr covers nearly two orbits of the outer planet. Importantly,
        we observe two periastron passages of planet c and do not
        observe a coherent activity signature. Together with the
        previously reported astrometric acceleration of HAT-P-11 from
        Hipparcos and Gaia, we believe there is strong evidence for
        HAT-P-11c as a bona fide planet.</p>

    <p>The probability that a Sun-like star has a close-orbiting giant planet
        (period \ensuremath≲1 yr) increases with stellar
        metallicity. Previous work provided evidence that the period
        distribution of close-orbiting giant planets is also linked to
        metallicity, hinting that there two formation/evolution pathways
        for such objects, one of which is more probable in high-
        metallicity environments. Here, we check for differences in the
        period distribution of hot Jupiters (P &lt; 10 days) as a function
        of host star metallicity, drawing on a sample of 232 transiting
        hot Jupiters and homogeneously derived metallicities from Gaia
        Data Release 3. We found no evidence for any metallicity
        dependence; the period distributions of hot Jupiters around
        metal-poor and metal-rich stars are indistinguishable. As a
        byproduct of this study, we provide transformations between
        metallicities from the Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrograph and
        from traditional high-resolution optical spectroscopy of main-
        sequence FGK stars.</p>

    <p>NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission promises to
        improve our understanding of hot Jupiters by providing an all-
        sky, magnitude-limited sample of transiting hot Jupiters
        suitable for population studies. Assembling such a sample
        requires confirming hundreds of planet candidates with
        additional follow-up observations. Here we present 20 hot
        Jupiters that were detected using TESS data and confirmed to be
        planets through photometric, spectroscopic, and imaging
        observations coordinated by the TESS Follow-up Observing
        Program. These 20 planets have orbital periods shorter than 7
        days and orbit relatively bright FGK stars (10.9 &lt; G &lt; 13.0).
        Most of the planets are comparable in mass to Jupiter, although
        there are four planets with masses less than that of Saturn.
        TOI-3976b, the longest-period planet in our sample (P = 6.6
        days), may be on a moderately eccentric orbit (e = 0.18
        \ensuremath\pm 0.06), while observations of the other
        targets are consistent with them being on circular orbits. We
        measured the projected stellar obliquity of TOI-1937A b, a hot
        Jupiter on a 22.4 hr orbit with the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect,
        finding the planet’s orbit to be well aligned with the stellar
        spin axis
        (\ensuremath∣\ensuremathλ\ensuremath∣ =
        4.\textdegree0 \ensuremath\pm 3.\textdegree5). We also
        investigated the possibility that TOI-1937 is a member of the
        NGC 2516 open cluster but ultimately found the evidence for
        cluster membership to be ambiguous. These objects are part of a
        larger effort to build a complete sample of hot Jupiters to be
        used for future demographic and detailed characterization work.
        *This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan
        Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile</p>

    <p>Hot Jupiters-short-period giant planets-were the first extrasolar
        planets to be discovered, but many questions about their origin
        remain. NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), an
        all-sky search for transiting planets, presents an opportunity
        to address these questions by constructing a uniform sample of
        hot Jupiters for demographic study through new detections and
        unifying the work of previous ground-based transit surveys. As
        the first results of an effort to build this large sample of
        planets, we report here the discovery of 10 new hot Jupiters
        (TOI-2193A b, TOI-2207b, TOI-2236b, TOI-2421b, TOI-2567b,
        TOI-2570b, TOI-3331b, TOI-3540A b, TOI-3693b, TOI-4137b). All of
        the planets were identified as planet candidates based on
        periodic flux dips observed by TESS, and were subsequently
        confirmed using ground-based time-series photometry, high-
        angular-resolution imaging, and high-resolution spectroscopy
        coordinated with the TESS Follow-up Observing Program. The 10
        newly discovered planets orbit relatively bright F and G stars
        (G &lt; 12.5, T _eff between 4800 and 6200 K). The planets’
        orbital periods range from 2 to 10 days, and their masses range
        from 0.2 to 2.2 Jupiter masses. TOI-2421b is notable for being a
        Saturn-mass planet and TOI-2567b for being a “sub-Saturn,”
        with masses of 0.322 \ensuremath\pm 0.073 and 0.195
        \ensuremath\pm 0.030 Jupiter masses, respectively. We also
        measured a detectably eccentric orbit (e = 0.17
        \ensuremath\pm 0.05) for TOI-2207b, a planet on an 8 day
        orbit, while placing an upper limit of e &lt; 0.052 for TOI-3693b,
        which has a 9 day orbital period. The 10 planets described here
        represent an important step toward using TESS to create a large
        and statistically useful sample of hot Jupiters.</p>

    <p>Hot Jupiters are a rare and interesting outcome of planet formation.
        Although more than 500 hot Jupiters (HJs) are known, most of
        them were discovered by a heterogeneous collection of surveys
        with selection biases that are difficult to quantify. Currently,
        our best knowledge of HJ demographics around FGK stars comes
        from the sample of \ensuremath≈40 objects detected by
        the Kepler mission, which have a well-quantified selection
        function. Using the Kepler results, we simulate the
        characteristics of the population of nearby transiting HJs. A
        comparison between the known sample of nearby HJs and simulated
        magnitude-limited samples leads to four conclusions. (1) The
        known sample of HJs appears to be \ensuremath≈75%
        complete for stars brighter than Gaia G \ensuremath≤
        10.5, falling to \ensuremath≲50% for G
        \ensuremath≤ 12. (2) There are probably a few
        undiscovered HJs with host stars brighter than G
        \ensuremath≈ 10 located within 10\textdegree of the
        Galactic plane. (3) The period and radius distributions of HJs
        may differ for F-type hosts (which dominate the nearby sample)
        and G-type hosts (which dominate the Kepler sample). (4) To
        obtain a magnitude-limited sample of HJs that is larger than the
        Kepler sample by an order of magnitude, the limiting magnitude
        should be approximately G \ensuremath≈ 12.5. This
        magnitude limit is within the range for which NASA’s Transiting
        Exoplanet Survey Satellite can easily detect HJs, presenting the
        opportunity to greatly expand our knowledge of hot-Jupiter
        demographics.</p>

    <p>Transit surveys have revealed a significant population of compact
        multiplanet systems, containing several sub-Neptune-mass planets
        on close-in, tightly-packed orbits. These systems are thought to
        have formed through a final phase of giant impacts, which would
        tend to leave systems close to the edge of stability. Here, we
        assess this hypothesis, comparing observed eccentricities in
        systems exhibiting transit-timing variations versus the maximum
        eccentricities compatible with long-term stability. We use the
        machine-learning classifier SPOCK (Tamayo et al.) to rapidly
        classify the stability of numerous initial configurations and
        hence determine these stability limits. While previous studies
        have argued that multiplanet systems are often maximally packed,
        in the sense that they could not host any additional planets, we
        find that the existing planets in these systems have measured
        eccentricities below the limits allowed by stability by a factor
        of 2-10. We compare these results against predictions from the
        giant-impact theory of planet formation, derived from both
        N-body integrations and theoretical expectations that, in the
        absence of dissipation, the orbits of such planets should be
        distributed uniformly throughout the phase space volume allowed
        by stability. We find that the observed systems have
        systematically lower eccentricities than this scenario predicts,
        with a median eccentricity about four times lower than
        predicted. This suggests that, if these systems formed through
        giant impacts, then some dissipation must occur to damp their
        eccentricities. This may occur through interactions with the
        natal gas disk or a leftover population of planetesimals, or
        over longer timescales through the coupling of tidal and secular
        processes.</p>

    <p>WASP-12b is a transiting hot Jupiter on a 1.09 day orbit around a late-F
        star. Since the planet’s discovery in 2008, the
        time interval between transits has been decreasing by 29
        \ensuremath\pm 2 ms yr^-1. This is a possible sign of
        orbital decay, although the previously available data left open
        the possibility that the planet’s orbit is
        slightly eccentric and is undergoing apsidal precession. Here,
        we present new transit and occultation observations that provide
        more decisive evidence for orbital decay, which is favored over
        apsidal precession by a {{\ensuremath∆ }}{BIC} of
        22.3 or Bayes factor of 70,000. We also present new radial-
        velocity data that rule out the Rømer effect as the cause of
        the period change. This makes WASP-12 the first planetary system
        for which we can be confident that the orbit is decaying. The
        decay timescale for the orbit is
        P/\textbackslashdot{P}=3.25+/- 0.23 {Myr}. Interpreting the
        decay as the result of tidal dissipation, the modified stellar
        tidal quality factor is {Q}_\textbackslashstar
        ^{\textbackslashprime }=1.8\texttimes {10}^5.</p>

    <p>HAT-P-11 is a mid-K dwarf that hosts one of the first Neptune-sized
        planets found outside the solar system. The orbit of HAT-P-11b
        is misaligned with the star’s
        spin—one of the few known cases of a misaligned
        planet orbiting a star less massive than the Sun. We find an
        additional planet in the system based on a decade of precision
        radial velocity (RV) measurements from Keck/High Resolution
        Echelle Spectrometer. HAT-P-11c is similar to Jupiter in its
        mass ({M}_P\textbackslashsin i=1.6+/- 0.1 M _ J ) and
        orbital period (P={9.3}_-0.5^+1.0 year), but has a
        much more eccentric orbit (e = 0.60 \ensuremath\pm 0.03). In
        our joint modeling of RV and stellar activity, we found an
        activity-induced RV signal of \ensuremath∼7 {{m}}
        {{{s}}}^-1, consistent with other active K dwarfs, but
        significantly smaller than the 31 {{m}} {{{s}}}^-1
        reflex motion due to HAT-P-11c. We investigated the dynamical
        coupling between HAT-P-11b and c as a possible explanation for
        HAT-P-11b’s misaligned orbit, finding that
        planet-planet Kozai interactions cannot tilt planet
        b’s orbit due to general relativistic
        precession; however, nodal precession operating on million year
        timescales is a viable mechanism to explain
        HAT-P-11b’s high obliquity. This leaves open the
        question of why HAT-P-11c may have such a tilted orbit. At a
        distance of 38 pc, the HAT-P-11 system offers rich opportunities
        for further exoplanet characterization through astrometry and
        direct imaging.</p>

    <p>Classification of stars, by comparing their optical spectra to a few
        dozen spectral standards, has been a workhorse of observational
        astronomy for more than a century. Here, we extend this
        technique by compiling a library of optical spectra of 404
        touchstone stars observed with Keck/HIRES by the California
        Planet Search. The spectra have high resolution (R
        \ensuremath≈ 60,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N
        \ensuremath≈ 150/pixel), and are registered onto a
        common wavelength scale. The library stars have properties
        derived from interferometry, asteroseismology, LTE spectral
        synthesis, and spectrophotometry. To address a lack of well-
        characterized late-K dwarfs in the literature, we measure
        stellar radii and temperatures for 23 nearby K dwarfs, using
        modeling of the spectral energy distribution and Gaia
        parallaxes. This library represents a uniform data set spanning
        the spectral types \ensuremath∼M5-F1 (T _eff
        \ensuremath≈ 3000-7000 K, R _\ensuremath⋆
        \ensuremath≈ 0.1-16 R _\ensuremath⊙). We
        also present “Empirical
        SpecMatch” (SpecMatch-Emp), a tool for
        parameterizing unknown spectra by comparing them against our
        spectral library. For FGKM stars, SpecMatch-Emp achieves
        accuracies of 100 K in effective temperature (T _eff), 15%
        in stellar radius (R _\ensuremath⋆), and 0.09 dex in
        metallicity ([Fe/H]). Because the code relies on empirical
        spectra it performs particularly well for stars
        \ensuremath∼K4 and later, which are challenging to model
        with existing spectral synthesizers, reaching accuracies of 70 K
        in T _eff, 10% in R _\ensuremath⋆, and 0.12 dex
        in [Fe/H]. We also validate the performance of SpecMatch-Emp,
        finding it to be robust at lower spectral resolution and S/N,
        enabling the characterization of faint late-type stars. Both the
        library and stellar characterization code are publicly
        available.</p>
