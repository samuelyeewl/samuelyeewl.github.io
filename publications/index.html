    <p>NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission promises to
        improve our understanding of hot Jupiters by providing an all-
        sky, magnitude-limited sample of transiting hot Jupiters
        suitable for population studies. Assembling such a sample
        requires confirming hundreds of planet candidates with
        additional follow-up observations. Here, we present twenty hot
        Jupiters that were detected using TESS data and confirmed to be
        planets through photometric, spectroscopic, and imaging
        observations coordinated by the TESS Follow-up Observing Program
        (TFOP). These twenty planets have orbital periods shorter than 7
        days and orbit relatively bright FGK stars (10.9 &lt; G &lt; 13.0).
        Most of the planets are comparable in mass to Jupiter, although
        there are four planets with masses less than that of Saturn.
        TOI-3976 b, the longest period planet in our sample (P = 6.6
        days), may be on a moderately eccentric orbit (e =
        0.18\pm0.06), while observations of the other targets are
        consistent with them being on circular orbits. We measured the
        projected stellar obliquity of TOI-1937A b, a hot Jupiter on a
        22.4 hour orbit with the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, finding the
        planet’s orbit to be well-aligned with the stellar spin axis
        (|λ| = 4.0\pm3.5^∘). We also investigated the
        possibility that TOI-1937 is a member of the NGC 2516 open
        cluster, but ultimately found the evidence for cluster
        membership to be ambiguous. These objects are part of a larger
        effort to build a complete sample of hot Jupiters to be used for
        future demographic and detailed characterization work.</p>

    <p>Populating the exoplanet mass-radius diagram in order to identify the
        underlying relationship that governs planet composition is
        driving an interdisciplinary effort within the exoplanet
        community. The discovery of hot super-Earths - a high
        temperature, short-period subset of the super-Earth planet
        population - has presented many unresolved questions concerning
        the formation, evolution, and composition of rocky planets. We
        report the discovery of a transiting, ultra-short period hot
        super-Earth orbiting TOI-1075 (TIC 351601843), a nearby (d =
        61.4 pc) late K-/early M-dwarf star, using data from the
        Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The newly
        discovered planet has a radius of 1.791^+0.116_-0.081
        R_⊕, and an orbital period of 0.605 days (14.5 hours).
        We precisely measure the planet mass to be
        9.95^+1.36_-1.30 M_⊕ using radial velocity
        measurements obtained with the Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS),
        mounted on the Magellan II telescope. Our radial velocity data
        also show a long-term trend, suggesting an additional planet in
        the system. While TOI-1075 b is expected to have a substantial
        H/He atmosphere given its size relative to the radius gap, its
        high density (9.32^+2.05_-1.85 \rmg/cm^3) is likely
        inconsistent with this possibility. We explore TOI-1075 b’s
        location relative to the M-dwarf radius valley, evaluate the
        planet’s prospects for atmospheric characterization, and discuss
        potential planet formation mechanisms. Studying the TOI-1075
        system in the broader context of ultra-short period planetary
        systems is necessary for testing planet formation and evolution
        theories, density enhancing mechanisms, and for future
        atmospheric and surface characterization studies via emission
        spectroscopy with JWST.</p>

    <p>Hot Jupiters-short-period giant planets-were the first extrasolar
        planets to be discovered, but many questions about their origin
        remain. NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), an
        all-sky search for transiting planets, presents an opportunity
        to address these questions by constructing a uniform sample of
        hot Jupiters for demographic study through new detections and
        unifying the work of previous ground-based transit surveys. As
        the first results of an effort to build this large sample of
        planets, we report here the discovery of 10 new hot Jupiters
        (TOI-2193A b, TOI-2207b, TOI-2236b, TOI-2421b, TOI-2567b,
        TOI-2570b, TOI-3331b, TOI-3540A b, TOI-3693b, TOI-4137b). All of
        the planets were identified as planet candidates based on
        periodic flux dips observed by TESS, and were subsequently
        confirmed using ground-based time-series photometry, high-
        angular-resolution imaging, and high-resolution spectroscopy
        coordinated with the TESS Follow-up Observing Program. The 10
        newly discovered planets orbit relatively bright F and G stars
        (G &lt; 12.5, T_eff between 4800 and 6200 K). The planets’
        orbital periods range from 2 to 10 days, and their masses range
        from 0.2 to 2.2 Jupiter masses. TOI-2421b is notable for being a
        Saturn-mass planet and TOI-2567b for being a “sub-Saturn,”
        with masses of 0.322 +/- 0.073 and 0.195
        +/- 0.030 Jupiter masses, respectively. We also
        measured a detectably eccentric orbit (e = 0.17
        +/- 0.05) for TOI-2207b, a planet on an 8 day
        orbit, while placing an upper limit of e &lt; 0.052 for TOI-3693b,
        which has a 9 day orbital period. The 10 planets described here
        represent an important step toward using TESS to create a large
        and statistically useful sample of hot Jupiters.</p>

    <p>Hot Jupiters are a rare and interesting outcome of planet formation.
        Although more than 500 hot Jupiters (HJs) are known, most of
        them were discovered by a heterogeneous collection of surveys
        with selection biases that are difficult to quantify. Currently,
        our best knowledge of HJ demographics around FGK stars comes
        from the sample of ≈40 objects detected by the Kepler mission,
        which have a well-quantified selection function. Using the
        Kepler results, we simulate the characteristics of the
        population of nearby transiting HJs. A comparison between the
        known sample of nearby HJs and simulated magnitude-limited
        samples leads to four conclusions. (1) The known sample of HJs
        appears to be ≈75% complete for stars brighter than Gaia G
        ≤ 10.5, falling to ≤ 50%
        for G ≤ 12. (2) There are probably a few
        undiscovered HJs with host stars brighter than G ≈ 10 located
        within 10 degrees of the Galactic plane. (3) The period and
        radius distributions of HJs may differ for F-type hosts (which
        dominate the nearby sample) and G-type hosts (which dominate the

        that is larger than the Kepler sample by an order of magnitude,
        the limiting magnitude should be approximately G ≈ 12.5. This
        magnitude limit is within the range for which NASA’s Transiting
        Exoplanet Survey Satellite can easily detect HJs, presenting the

    <p>Transit surveys have revealed a significant population of compact multiplanet systems, containing several sub-Neptune-mass planets on close-in, tightly-packed orbits. These systems are thought to have formed through a final phase of giant impacts, which would tend to leave systems close to the edge of stability. Here, we assess this hypothesis, comparing observed eccentricities in systems exhibiting transit-timing variations versus the maximum eccentricities compatible with long-term stability. We use the machine-learning classifier SPOCK (Tamayo et al.) to rapidly classify the stability of numerous initial configurations and hence determine these stability limits. While previous studies have argued that multiplanet systems are often maximally packed, in the sense that they could not host any additional planets, we find that the existing planets in these systems have measured eccentricities below the limits allowed by stability by a factor of 2-10. We compare these results against predictions from the giant-impact theory of planet formation, derived from both N-body integrations and theoretical expectations that, in the absence of dissipation, the orbits of such planets should be distributed uniformly throughout the phase space volume allowed by stability. We find that the observed systems have systematically lower eccentricities than this scenario predicts, with a median eccentricity about four times lower than predicted. This suggests that, if these systems formed through giant impacts, then some dissipation must occur to damp their eccentricities. This may occur through interactions with the natal gas disk or a leftover population of planetesimals, or over longer timescales through the coupling of tidal and secular processes.</p>

    <p>WASP-12b is a transiting hot Jupiter on a 1.09 day orbit around a late-F star. Since the planet’s discovery in 2008, the time interval between transits has been decreasing by 29 ± 2 ms yr-1. This is a possible sign of orbital decay, although the previously available data left open the possibility that the planet’s orbit is slightly eccentric and is undergoing apsidal precession. Here, we present new transit and occultation observations that provide more decisive evidence for orbital decay, which is favored over apsidal precession by a ΔBIC of 22.3 or Bayes factor of 70,000. We also present new radial-velocity data that rule out the Rømer effect as the cause of the period change. This makes WASP-12 the first planetary system for which we can be confident that the orbit is decaying. The decay timescale for the orbit is P/\dotP=3.25+/- 0.23 Myr. Interpreting the decay as the result of tidal dissipation, the modified stellar tidal quality factor is Q_⋆^\prime = 1.8 \times 10^5.</p>

    <p>HAT-P-11 is a mid-K dwarf that hosts one of the first Neptune-sized planets found outside the solar system. The orbit of HAT-P-11b is misaligned with the star’s spin—one of the few known cases of a misaligned planet orbiting a star less massive than the Sun. We find an additional planet in the system based on a decade of precision radial velocity (RV) measurements from Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer. HAT-P-11c is similar to Jupiter in its mass (M_P sin i=1.6 ± 0.1 M_J ) and orbital period (P=9.3-0.5+1.0 year), but has a much more eccentric orbit (e = 0.60 ± 0.03). In our joint modeling of RV and stellar activity, we found an activity-induced RV signal of ∼7 m s-1, consistent with other active K dwarfs, but significantly smaller than the 31 m s-1 reflex motion due to HAT-P-11c. We investigated the dynamical coupling between HAT-P-11b and c as a possible explanation for HAT-P-11b’s misaligned orbit, finding that planet–planet Kozai interactions cannot tilt planet b’s orbit due to general relativistic precession; however, nodal precession operating on million year timescales is a viable mechanism to explain HAT-P-11b’s high obliquity. This leaves open the question of why HAT-P-11c may have such a tilted orbit. At a distance of 38 pc, the HAT-P-11 system offers rich opportunities for further exoplanet characterization through astrometry and direct imaging.</p>

    <p>We present 151 planet candidates orbiting 141 stars from K2 campaigns 5–8 (C5–C8), identified through a systematic search of K2 photometry. In addition, we identify 16 targets as likely eclipsing binaries, based on their light curve morphology. We obtained follow-up optical spectra of 105/141 candidate host stars and 8/16 eclipsing binaries to improve stellar properties and to identify spectroscopic binaries. Importantly, spectroscopy enables measurements of host star radii with ≈10% precision, compared to ≈40% precision when only broadband photometry is available. The improved stellar radii enable improved planet radii. Our curated catalog of planet candidates provides a starting point for future efforts to confirm and characterize K2 discoveries.</p>

    <p>Classification of stars, by comparing their optical spectra to a few dozen spectral standards, has been a workhorse of observational astronomy for more than a century. Here, we extend this technique by compiling a library of optical spectra of 404 touchstone stars observed with Keck/HIRES by the California Planet Search. The spectra have high resolution (R ≈ 60,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ≈ 150/pixel), and are registered onto a common wavelength scale. The library stars have properties derived from interferometry, asteroseismology, LTE spectral synthesis, and spectrophotometry. To address a lack of well-characterized late-K dwarfs in the literature, we measure stellar radii and temperatures for 23 nearby K dwarfs, using modeling of the spectral energy distribution and Gaia parallaxes. This library represents a uniform data set spanning the spectral types ˜M5-F1 (Teff ≈ 3000-7000 K, R ⋆ ≈ 0.1-16 R ⊙). We also present “Empirical SpecMatch” (SpecMatch-Emp), a tool for parameterizing unknown spectra by comparing them against our spectral library. For FGKM stars, SpecMatch-Emp achieves accuracies of 100 K in effective temperature (Teff), 15% in stellar radius (R ⋆), and 0.09 dex in metallicity ([Fe/H]). Because the code relies on empirical spectra it performs particularly well for stars ˜K4 and later, which are challenging to model with existing spectral synthesizers, reaching accuracies of 70 K in T eff, 10% in R ⋆, and 0.12 dex in [Fe/H]. We also validate the performance of SpecMatch-Emp, finding it to be robust at lower spectral resolution and S/N, enabling the characterization of faint late-type stars. Both the library and stellar characterization code are publicly available.</p>

    <p>The International Young Physicists’ Tournament (IYPT) is a worldwide, annual competition for high school students. This paper is adapted from the winning solution to Problem 14, Magnetic Spring, as presented in the final round of the 23rd IYPT in Vienna, Austria. Two magnets were arranged on top of each other on a common axis. One was fixed, while the other could move vertically. Various parameters of interest were investigated, including the effective gravitational acceleration, the strength, size, mass and geometry of the magnets, and damping of the oscillations. Despite its simplicity, this setup yielded a number of interesting and unexpected relations. The first stage of the investigation was concerned only with the undamped oscillations of small amplitudes, and the period of small amplitude oscillations was found to be dependent only on the eighth root of important magnet properties such as its strength and mass. The second stage sought to investigate more general oscillations. A numerical model which took into account magnet size, magnet geometry and damping effects was developed to model the general oscillations. Air resistance and friction were found to be significant sources of damping, while eddy currents were negligible.</p>
