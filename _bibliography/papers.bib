        an M4 host, whose transits display large and persistent spot-
        crossing events. We used the Tierras Observatory to monitor both
        the long-term photometric variability of TOI-3884 and changes in
        the spot-crossing events across multiple transits of the planet.
        We show that the star rotates with a period of $11.020
        \pm 0.015$ days. We simultaneously model the
        rotational modulation of the star and variations in transit
        shapes that arise due to rotation of the spot, allowing us to
        determine the true stellar obliquity,
        $\psi_\star$. The data are best
        described by a planet on a misaligned orbit around a highly
        inclined star ($\psi_\star = 77.4_{-2.5}^{+2.3}{^\circ}$;
        $i_\star = 22.3_{-1.6}^{+1.8}{^\circ}$) that hosts
        a large polar starspot ($r_\mathrm{spot} = 31.2_{-1.9}^{+2.4}{^\circ}$;
        $\lambda_\mathrm{spot} = 70.5^{\circ} \pm 1.2^{\circ}$).
        Archival photometry from
        the Zwicky Transient Facility suggests that this polar spot has
        persisted on TOI-3884 for at least seven years. The TOI-3884

     abstract = "{The ``Neptunian ridge`` is a recently identified peak in the frequency
        of planets with sizes between that of Neptune and Saturn
        orbiting their host stars with periods between 3 and 6 days (A.
        Castro-Gonz{\'a}lez et al. 2024). These planets may have formed
        similarly to their larger, hot Jupiter counterparts in the
        ``three-day pile-up'', through a dynamically excited migration
        pathway. The distribution of stellar obliquities in hot Neptune
        systems may therefore provide a vital clue as to their origin.
        We report a new stellar obliquity measurement for
        TOI-2374\textbackslash,b, a planet in the Neptunian ridge ($P =
        4.31$ days, $R_p = 7.5 R_\oplus$). We observed a spectroscopic
        transit of TOI-2374 b with the Keck Planet Finder, detecting the
        Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) anomaly with an amplitude of 3 m/s, and
        measured a sky-projected obliquity of $λ=
        {81^\circ}^{+23^\circ}_{-22^\circ}$, indicating an orbit
        significantly misaligned with the spin axis of its host star. A
        reloaded RM analysis of the cross-correlation functions confirms
        this misalignment, measuring $λ=
        {65^\circ}^{+32^\circ}_{-24^\circ}$. Additionally, we measured a
        stellar rotation period of $P_\mathrm{rot} = 26.4^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$
        days with photometry from the Tierras observatory, allowing us
        to deduce the three-dimensional stellar obliquity of $ψ=
        {85.9^\circ}^{+8.6^\circ}_{-9.2^\circ}$. TOI-2374 b joins a
        growing number of hot Neptunes on polar orbits. The high
        frequency of misaligned orbits for Neptunian ridge and desert
        planets, compared with their longer period counterparts, is
        reminiscent of patterns seen for the giant planets and may
        suggest a similar formation mechanism.}",

        requires confirming hundreds of planet candidates with
        additional follow-up observations. Here we present 20 hot
        Jupiters that were detected using TESS data and confirmed to be
        planets through photometric, spectroscopic, and imaging
        observations coordinated by the TESS Follow-up Observing
        Program. These 20 planets have orbital periods shorter than 7
        days and orbit relatively bright FGK stars (10.9 < G < 13.0).
        Most of the planets are comparable in mass to Jupiter, although
        there are four planets with masses less than that of Saturn.
        TOI-3976b, the longest-period planet in our sample (P = 6.6
        days), may be on a moderately eccentric orbit (e = 0.18
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.06), while observations of the other
        targets are consistent with them being on circular orbits. We
        measured the projected stellar obliquity of TOI-1937A b, a hot
        Jupiter on a 22.4 hr orbit with the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect,
        finding the planet's orbit to be well aligned with the stellar
        spin axis

        4.{\textdegree}0 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 3.{\textdegree}5). We also
        investigated the possibility that TOI-1937 is a member of the
        NGC 2516 open cluster but ultimately found the evidence for
        cluster membership to be ambiguous. These objects are part of a
        larger effort to build a complete sample of hot Jupiters to be

        all-sky search for transiting planets, presents an opportunity
        to address these questions by constructing a uniform sample of
        hot Jupiters for demographic study through new detections and
        unifying the work of previous ground-based transit surveys. As
        the first results of an effort to build this large sample of
        planets, we report here the discovery of 10 new hot Jupiters
        (TOI-2193A b, TOI-2207b, TOI-2236b, TOI-2421b, TOI-2567b,
        TOI-2570b, TOI-3331b, TOI-3540A b, TOI-3693b, TOI-4137b). All of
        the planets were identified as planet candidates based on
        periodic flux dips observed by TESS, and were subsequently
        confirmed using ground-based time-series photometry, high-
        angular-resolution imaging, and high-resolution spectroscopy
        coordinated with the TESS Follow-up Observing Program. The 10
        newly discovered planets orbit relatively bright F and G stars
        (G < 12.5, T $_{eff}$ between 4800 and 6200 K). The planets'
        orbital periods range from 2 to 10 days, and their masses range
        from 0.2 to 2.2 Jupiter masses. TOI-2421b is notable for being a
        Saturn-mass planet and TOI-2567b for being a ``sub-Saturn,''
        with masses of 0.322 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.073 and 0.195
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.030 Jupiter masses, respectively. We also

        orbit, while placing an upper limit of e < 0.052 for TOI-3693b,

        Although more than 500 hot Jupiters (HJs) are known, most of
        them were discovered by a heterogeneous collection of surveys
        with selection biases that are difficult to quantify. Currently,
        our best knowledge of HJ demographics around FGK stars comes
        from the sample of {\ensuremath{\approx}}40 objects detected by
        the Kepler mission, which have a well-quantified selection
        function. Using the Kepler results, we simulate the
        characteristics of the population of nearby transiting HJs. A
        comparison between the known sample of nearby HJs and simulated
        magnitude-limited samples leads to four conclusions. (1) The
        known sample of HJs appears to be {\ensuremath{\approx}}75\%
        complete for stars brighter than Gaia G {\ensuremath{\leq}}
        10.5, falling to {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}50\% for G
        {\ensuremath{\leq}} 12. (2) There are probably a few
        undiscovered HJs with host stars brighter than G
        {\ensuremath{\approx}} 10 located within 10{\textdegree} of the
        Galactic plane. (3) The period and radius distributions of HJs
        may differ for F-type hosts (which dominate the nearby sample)
        and G-type hosts (which dominate the Kepler sample). (4) To
        obtain a magnitude-limited sample of HJs that is larger than the
        Kepler sample by an order of magnitude, the limiting magnitude
        should be approximately G {\ensuremath{\approx}} 12.5. This
        magnitude limit is within the range for which NASA's Transiting
        Exoplanet Survey Satellite can easily detect HJs, presenting the

        multiplanet systems, containing several sub-Neptune-mass planets
        on close-in, tightly-packed orbits. These systems are thought to
        have formed through a final phase of giant impacts, which would
        tend to leave systems close to the edge of stability. Here, we
        assess this hypothesis, comparing observed eccentricities in
        systems exhibiting transit-timing variations versus the maximum
        eccentricities compatible with long-term stability. We use the
        machine-learning classifier SPOCK (Tamayo et al.) to rapidly
        classify the stability of numerous initial configurations and
        hence determine these stability limits. While previous studies
        have argued that multiplanet systems are often maximally packed,
        in the sense that they could not host any additional planets, we
        find that the existing planets in these systems have measured
        eccentricities below the limits allowed by stability by a factor
        of 2-10. We compare these results against predictions from the
        giant-impact theory of planet formation, derived from both
        N-body integrations and theoretical expectations that, in the
        absence of dissipation, the orbits of such planets should be
        distributed uniformly throughout the phase space volume allowed
        by stability. We find that the observed systems have
        systematically lower eccentricities than this scenario predicts,
        with a median eccentricity about four times lower than
        predicted. This suggests that, if these systems formed through
        giant impacts, then some dissipation must occur to damp their
        eccentricities. This may occur through interactions with the
        natal gas disk or a leftover population of planetesimals, or
        over longer timescales through the coupling of tidal and secular
        processes.}",

        parameterizing unknown spectra by comparing them against our
        spectral library. For FGKM stars, SpecMatch-Emp achieves
        accuracies of 100 K in effective temperature (T $_{eff}$), 15\%
        in stellar radius (R $_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$), and 0.09 dex in
        metallicity ([Fe/H]). Because the code relies on empirical
        spectra it performs particularly well for stars
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}K4 and later, which are challenging to model
        with existing spectral synthesizers, reaching accuracies of 70 K
        in T $_{eff}$, 10\% in R $_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$, and 0.12 dex
        in [Fe/H]. We also validate the performance of SpecMatch-Emp,
        finding it to be robust at lower spectral resolution and S/N,
        enabling the characterization of faint late-type stars. Both the
        library and stellar characterization code are publicly
        available.}",
