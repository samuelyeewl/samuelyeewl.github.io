        Interest (TOIs) hosting 108 planet candidates that compose the
        TESS-Keck Survey (TKS) sample. We combine photometry, high-
        resolution spectroscopy, and Gaia parallaxes to measure precise
        and accurate stellar properties. We then use these parameters as
        inputs to a light-curve processing pipeline to recover planetary
        signals and homogeneously fit their transit properties. Among
        these transit fits, we detect significant transit-timing
        variations among at least three multiplanet systems (TOI-1136,
        TOI-1246, TOI-1339) and at least one single-planet system
        (TOI-1279). We also reduce the uncertainties on planet-to-star
        radius ratios R $_{p}$ /R $_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ across our
        sample, from a median fractional uncertainty of 8.8\% among the
        original TOI Catalog values to 3.0\% among our updated results.
        With this improvement, we are able to recover the Radius Gap
        among small TKS planets and find that the topology of the Radius
        Gap among our sample is broadly consistent with that measured
        among Kepler planets. The stellar and planetary properties
        presented here will facilitate follow-up investigations of both
        individual TOIs and broader trends in planet properties, system
        dynamics, and the evolution of planetary systems.}",

        population of transiting exoplanets around early-type stars is
        still limited. These planets allow us to investigate the planet
        properties and formation pathways over a wide range of stellar
        masses and study the impact of high irradiation on hot Jupiters
        orbiting such stars. We report the discovery of TOI-615b,
        TOI-622b, and TOI-2641b, three Saturn-mass planets transiting
        main sequence, F-type stars. The planets were identified by the
        Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and confirmed with
        complementary ground-based and radial velocity observations.
        TOI-615b is a highly irradiated

        0.43$_{{\ensuremath{-}}0.08}$$^{+0.09}$ M$_{Jup}$) in a 4.66 day
        orbit transiting a 6850 K star. TOI-622b has a radius of
        0.82$_{{\ensuremath{-}}0.03}$$^{+0.03}$ R$_{Jup}$ and a mass of
        0.30$_{{\ensuremath{-}}0.08}$$^{+0.07}$ M$_{Jup}$ in a 6.40 day
        orbit. Despite its high insolation flux
        (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde600
        F$^{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$), TOI-622b does not show any
        evidence of radius inflation. TOI-2641b is a
        0.39$_{{\ensuremath{-}}0.04}$$^{+0.02}$ M$_{Jup}$ planet in a
        4.88 day orbit with a grazing transit (b =
        1.04$_{{\ensuremath{-}}0.06}$$^{+0.05}$) that results in a
        poorly constrained radius of
        1.61$_{{\ensuremath{-}}0.64}$$^{+0.46}$ R$_{Jup}$. Additionally,
        TOI-615b is considered attractive for atmospheric studies via
        transmission spectroscopy with ground-based spectrographs and
        JWST. Future atmospheric and spin-orbit alignment observations
        are essential since they can provide information on the
        atmospheric composition, formation, and migration of exoplanets
        across various stellar types. \textbackslash\textbackslashThe

        of host star metallicity, drawing on a sample of 232 transiting

        metal-poor and metal-rich stars are indistinguishable. As a
        byproduct of this study, we provide transformations between

        providing spectroscopic parameters for 310 K2 targets -including
        239 Scaling K2 hosts-observed with Keck/HIRES. For orbital
        periods less than 40 days, we found that the distribution of
        planets as a function of orbital period, stellar effective
        temperature, and metallicity was consistent between K2 and
        Kepler, reflecting consistent planet formation efficiency across
        numerous \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde1 kpc sight-lines in
        the local Milky Way. Additionally, we detected a 3{\texttimes}
        excess of sub-Saturns relative to warm Jupiters beyond 10 days,
        suggesting a closer association between sub-Saturn and sub-
        Neptune formation than between sub-Saturn and Jovian formation.
        Performing a joint analysis of Kepler and K2 demographics, we
        observed diminishing super-Earth, sub-Neptune, and sub-Saturn
        populations at higher stellar effective temperatures, implying
        an inverse relationship between formation and disk mass. In
        contrast, no apparent host-star spectral-type dependence was
        identified for our population of Jupiters, which indicates gas-
        giant formation saturates within the FGK mass regimes. We
        present support for stellar metallicity trends reported by
        previous Kepler analyses. Using Gaia DR3 proper motion and
        radial velocity measurements, we discovered a galactic location
        trend; stars that make large vertical excursions from the plane
        of the Milky Way host fewer super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. While
        oscillation amplitude is associated with metallicity,
        metallicity alone cannot explain the observed trend,
        demonstrating that galactic influences are imprinted on the
        planet population. Overall, our results provide new insights
        into the distribution of planets around FGK dwarf stars and the
        factors that influence their formation and evolution.}",

        requires confirming hundreds of planet candidates with
        additional follow-up observations. Here we present 20 hot
        Jupiters that were detected using TESS data and confirmed to be
        planets through photometric, spectroscopic, and imaging
        observations coordinated by the TESS Follow-up Observing
        Program. These 20 planets have orbital periods shorter than 7
        days and orbit relatively bright FGK stars (10.9 < G < 13.0).
        Most of the planets are comparable in mass to Jupiter, although
        there are four planets with masses less than that of Saturn.
        TOI-3976b, the longest-period planet in our sample (P = 6.6
        days), may be on a moderately eccentric orbit (e = 0.18
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.06), while observations of the other
        targets are consistent with them being on circular orbits. We
        measured the projected stellar obliquity of TOI-1937A b, a hot
        Jupiter on a 22.4 hr orbit with the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect,
        finding the planet's orbit to be well aligned with the stellar
        spin axis

        investigated the possibility that TOI-1937 is a member of the
        NGC 2516 open cluster but ultimately found the evidence for
        cluster membership to be ambiguous. These objects are part of a
        larger effort to build a complete sample of hot Jupiters to be

      abstract = "{Populating the exoplanet mass-radius diagram in order to identify the
        underlying relationship that governs planet composition is
        driving an interdisciplinary effort within the exoplanet
        community. The discovery of hot super-Earths - a high
        temperature, short-period subset of the super-Earth planet
        population - has presented many unresolved questions concerning
        the formation, evolution, and composition of rocky planets. We
        report the discovery of a transiting, ultra-short period hot
        super-Earth orbiting TOI-1075 (TIC 351601843), a nearby ($d$ =
        61.4 pc) late K-/early M-dwarf star, using data from the
        Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The newly
        discovered planet has a radius of $1.791^{+0.116}_{-0.081}$
        $R_{\oplus}$, and an orbital period of 0.605 days (14.5 hours).
        We precisely measure the planet mass to be
        $9.95^{+1.36}_{-1.30}$ $M_{\oplus}$ using radial velocity
        measurements obtained with the Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS),
        mounted on the Magellan II telescope. Our radial velocity data
        also show a long-term trend, suggesting an additional planet in
        the system. While TOI-1075 b is expected to have a substantial
        H/He atmosphere given its size relative to the radius gap, its
        high density ($9.32^{+2.05}_{-1.85}$ $\rm{g/cm^3}$) is likely
        inconsistent with this possibility. We explore TOI-1075 b's
        location relative to the M-dwarf radius valley, evaluate the
        planet's prospects for atmospheric characterization, and discuss
        potential planet formation mechanisms. Studying the TOI-1075
        system in the broader context of ultra-short period planetary
        systems is necessary for testing planet formation and evolution
        theories, density enhancing mechanisms, and for future
        atmospheric and surface characterization studies via emission

     abstract = "{Hot Jupiters-short-period giant planets-were the first extrasolar
        planets to be discovered, but many questions about their origin
        remain. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), an
        all-sky search for transiting planets, presents an opportunity
        to address these questions by constructing a uniform sample of
        hot Jupiters for demographic study through new detections and
        unifying the work of previous ground-based transit surveys. As
        the first results of an effort to build this large sample of
        planets, we report here the discovery of 10 new hot Jupiters
        (TOI-2193A b, TOI-2207b, TOI-2236b, TOI-2421b, TOI-2567b,
        TOI-2570b, TOI-3331b, TOI-3540A b, TOI-3693b, TOI-4137b). All of
        the planets were identified as planet candidates based on
        periodic flux dips observed by TESS, and were subsequently
        confirmed using ground-based time-series photometry, high-
        angular-resolution imaging, and high-resolution spectroscopy
        coordinated with the TESS Follow-up Observing Program. The 10
        newly discovered planets orbit relatively bright F and G stars
        (G < 12.5, T_eff between 4800 and 6200 K). The planets'
        orbital periods range from 2 to 10 days, and their masses range
        from 0.2 to 2.2 Jupiter masses. TOI-2421b is notable for being a
        Saturn-mass planet and TOI-2567b for being a ``sub-Saturn,''
        with masses of 0.322 +/- 0.073 and 0.195
        +/- 0.030 Jupiter masses, respectively. We also
        measured a detectably eccentric orbit (e = 0.17
        +/- 0.05) for TOI-2207b, a planet on an 8 day
        orbit, while placing an upper limit of e < 0.052 for TOI-3693b,
        which has a 9 day orbital period. The 10 planets described here

        Although more than 500 hot Jupiters (HJs) are known, most of
        them were discovered by a heterogeneous collection of surveys
        with selection biases that are difficult to quantify. Currently,
        our best knowledge of HJ demographics around FGK stars comes
        from the sample of ≈40 objects detected by the Kepler mission,
        which have a well-quantified selection function. Using the
        Kepler results, we simulate the characteristics of the
        population of nearby transiting HJs. A comparison between the
        known sample of nearby HJs and simulated magnitude-limited
        samples leads to four conclusions. (1) The known sample of HJs
        appears to be ≈75\% complete for stars brighter than Gaia G
        ≤ 10.5, falling to ≤ 50\%
        for G ≤ 12. (2) There are probably a few
        undiscovered HJs with host stars brighter than G ≈ 10 located
        within 10 degrees of the Galactic plane. (3) The period and
        radius distributions of HJs may differ for F-type hosts (which
        dominate the nearby sample) and G-type hosts (which dominate the
        Kepler sample). (4) To obtain a magnitude-limited sample of HJs
        that is larger than the Kepler sample by an order of magnitude,
        the limiting magnitude should be approximately G ≈ 12.5. This
        magnitude limit is within the range for which NASA's Transiting
        Exoplanet Survey Satellite can easily detect HJs, presenting the

      journal = {The Astronomical Journal},
      abstract = "{Transit surveys have revealed a significant population of compact multiplanet systems, containing several sub-Neptune-mass planets on close-in, tightly-packed orbits. These systems are thought to have formed through a final phase of giant impacts, which would tend to leave systems close to the edge of stability. Here, we assess this hypothesis, comparing observed eccentricities in systems exhibiting transit-timing variations versus the maximum eccentricities compatible with long-term stability. We use the machine-learning classifier SPOCK (Tamayo et al.) to rapidly classify the stability of numerous initial configurations and hence determine these stability limits. While previous studies have argued that multiplanet systems are often maximally packed, in the sense that they could not host any additional planets, we find that the existing planets in these systems have measured eccentricities below the limits allowed by stability by a factor of 2-10. We compare these results against predictions from the giant-impact theory of planet formation, derived from both N-body integrations and theoretical expectations that, in the absence of dissipation, the orbits of such planets should be distributed uniformly throughout the phase space volume allowed by stability. We find that the observed systems have systematically lower eccentricities than this scenario predicts, with a median eccentricity about four times lower than predicted. This suggests that, if these systems formed through giant impacts, then some dissipation must occur to damp their eccentricities. This may occur through interactions with the natal gas disk or a leftover population of planetesimals, or over longer timescales through the coupling of tidal and secular processes.}",

Since the planet’s discovery in 2008, the time interval between transits has been decreasing by 29 ± 2 ms yr-1. This is a possible sign of orbital decay, although the previously available data left open the possibility that the planet’s orbit is slightly eccentric and is undergoing apsidal precession. Here, we present new transit and occultation observations that provide more decisive evidence for orbital decay, which is favored over apsidal precession by a ΔBIC of 22.3 or Bayes factor of 70,000. We also present new radial-velocity data that rule out the Rømer effect as the cause of the period change. This makes WASP-12 the first planetary system for which we can be confident that the orbit is decaying. The decay timescale for the orbit is P/\dot{P}=3.25+/- 0.23 {Myr}. Interpreting the decay as the result of tidal dissipation, the modified stellar tidal quality factor is $Q_\star^\prime = 1.8 \times {10}^5$.}",

The orbit of HAT-P-11b is misaligned with the star’s spin—one of the few known cases of a misaligned planet orbiting a star less massive than the Sun. We find an additional planet in the system based on a decade of precision radial velocity (RV) measurements from Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer. HAT-P-11c is similar to Jupiter in its mass ($M_P sin i=1.6 ± 0.1 M_J$ ) and orbital period (P={9.3}-0.5+1.0 year), but has a much more eccentric orbit (e = 0.60 ± 0.03). In our joint modeling of RV and stellar activity, we found an activity-induced RV signal of ∼7 {{m}} {{{s}}}-1, consistent with other active K dwarfs, but significantly smaller than the 31 {{m}} {{{s}}}-1 reflex motion due to HAT-P-11c. We investigated the dynamical coupling between HAT-P-11b and c as a possible explanation for HAT-P-11b’s misaligned orbit, finding that planet–planet Kozai interactions cannot tilt planet b’s orbit due to general relativistic precession; however, nodal precession operating on million year timescales is a viable mechanism to explain HAT-P-11b’s high obliquity. This leaves open the question of why HAT-P-11c may have such a tilted orbit. At a distance of 38 pc, the HAT-P-11 system offers rich opportunities for further exoplanet characterization through astrometry and direct imaging.}",

    abstract = "{Classification of stars, by comparing their optical spectra to a few dozen spectral standards, has been a workhorse of observational astronomy for more than a century. Here, we extend this technique by compiling a library of optical spectra of 404 touchstone stars observed with Keck/HIRES by the California Planet Search. The spectra have high resolution (R ≈ 60,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ≈ 150/pixel), and are registered onto a common wavelength scale. The library stars have properties derived from interferometry, asteroseismology, LTE spectral synthesis, and spectrophotometry. To address a lack of well-characterized late-K dwarfs in the literature, we measure stellar radii and temperatures for 23 nearby K dwarfs, using modeling of the spectral energy distribution and Gaia parallaxes. This library represents a uniform data set spanning the spectral types ˜M5-F1 (Teff ≈ 3000-7000 K, R ⋆ ≈ 0.1-16 R ⊙). We also present “Empirical SpecMatch” (SpecMatch-Emp), a tool for parameterizing unknown spectra by comparing them against our spectral library. For FGKM stars, SpecMatch-Emp achieves accuracies of 100 K in effective temperature (Teff), 15% in stellar radius (R ⋆), and 0.09 dex in metallicity ([Fe/H]). Because the code relies on empirical spectra it performs particularly well for stars ˜K4 and later, which are challenging to model with existing spectral synthesizers, reaching accuracies of 70 K in T eff, 10% in R ⋆, and 0.12 dex in [Fe/H]. We also validate the performance of SpecMatch-Emp, finding it to be robust at lower spectral resolution and S/N, enabling the characterization of faint late-type stars. Both the library and stellar characterization code are publicly available.}",

  abstract={The International Young Physicists' Tournament (IYPT) is a worldwide, annual competition for high school students. This paper is adapted from the winning solution to Problem 14, Magnetic Spring, as presented in the final round of the 23rd IYPT in Vienna, Austria. Two magnets were arranged on top of each other on a common axis. One was fixed, while the other could move vertically. Various parameters of interest were investigated, including the effective gravitational acceleration, the strength, size, mass and geometry of the magnets, and damping of the oscillations. Despite its simplicity, this setup yielded a number of interesting and unexpected relations. The first stage of the investigation was concerned only with the undamped oscillations of small amplitudes, and the period of small amplitude oscillations was found to be dependent only on the eighth root of important magnet properties such as its strength and mass. The second stage sought to investigate more general oscillations. A numerical model which took into account magnet size, magnet geometry and damping effects was developed to model the general oscillations. Air resistance and friction were found to be significant sources of damping, while eddy currents were negligible.}
