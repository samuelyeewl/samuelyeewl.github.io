> It seemed like a matter of minutes when we began rolling in the foothills before Oakland and suddenly reached a height and saw stretched out ahead of us the fabulous white city of San Francisco on her eleven mystic hills with the blue Pacific and its advancing wall of potato-patch fog beyond, and smoke and goldenness in the late afternoon of time.”

> \- Jack Kerouac, On the Road

The sun was already rising as I hastily divided my possessions into two piles - the clothes I would need over the long summer; and the rest, all the ephemera accumulated over the course of a year at school, destined for storage until I returned.

And then, I was off. I caught an Uber out of Caltech as Wagner’s Ride of the Valkyries blared on speakers across campus. It’s a school tradition for the song to be played every morning of Finals Week, but I don’t think I’d ever been up early enough to have heard it. This time though, it seemed like a fitting soundtrack with which to end the school year, and begin an adventure.

Soon enough, I was on a bus departing Union Station, weaving its way through the early morning congestion, then hurtling down the the I-5. At last, I was leaving the dusty streets of Los Angeles behind for the wide, open road and the Golden City beyond.

I started reading Kerouac’s “On the Road” while I was in San Francisco. What better place to read the classic novel of the Beat Generation than in the city that was its spiritual home? Sal Paradise found himself irresistibly attracted to the life and dynamism, the joy and madness of San Francisco; this same energy is what has drawn me back to San Francisco for the third time in less than a year.

It’s a colourful city - in all senses of the word, from the architecture to the characters who inhabit this place. If I were to choose anywhere in the world to live, I think San Francisco would be near the top of my list.

Unlike Sal though, San Francisco wasn’t the target of my journey, it was only the start. And after just a couple of days of wandering the streets, it was time to move on again, to keep heading out to the unknown.
