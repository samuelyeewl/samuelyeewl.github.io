As the school year of 2015 drew to a close, I found myself forced to make plans for the long interstitial summer before the next year began. I’d thought that nine months of studying abroad would have tired me out, made me yearn for the familiarity of home. But while I was eager to leave the bubble of academia that is Caltech, I wasn’t yet ready to return home.

Perhaps it was precisely because of that long period spent away in a foreign land which made it easier for me to say that I wouldn’t go home just yet. Perhaps it was because of all the new things I had seen and done over the past year that made me want to experience even more. I was still restless, and I needed to sate that wanderlust, to stretch those legs, to get lost somewhere.

And so, armed with the excuse of attending my brother’s graduation in Cambridge, I decided that I would return to Singapore not by flying west from Los Angeles, but instead by heading east, the long way around.

It was an incredible journey. I spent 49 days travelling across three continents, both alone and with family and friends. I finally got to see foreign cities and landscapes which had always been the stuff of fable and fantasy, places I had only ever dreamed of visiting.

I arm-wrestled in Istanbul and swam in the Mediterranean; I marvelled beneath the towering skyscrapers of Manhattan and stood atop fortresses in Montenegro; I admired palaces and museums; I stumbled through mosques, synagogues, cathedrals, and basilicas.

For me, the thrill of this trip came not just from the places I visited, but also from the sense of motion - the fact of waking up every few mornings in a different city or country, the idea that I was exploring not just one place, but a slice of the world. There was also always that excitement from the physical act of moving, the 130 hours I spent on the road - in cars, buses, trains, boats and airplanes. 

And of course, there were the people, both locals and fellow travellers. Staying in hostels most of the way, I met people from all over the world and all walks of life. It made me realise that to travel is to be part of this great flow of people across the globe, a never-ending interchange of ideas and experiences, filled with chance encounters and unforgettable meetings. And that a common humanity belies all of us, whether you are the writer in a Chicago bar, or the student in the streets of Zagreb - we’re not all that different.

By the end of the seven weeks, as much as I wanted to keep going, I knew that I could not. I boarded the plane out of Istanbul a very different person from the one who had booked the ticket all those months before, not having a clue of what to expect, not knowing anything of the places I would visit except as names on a map. I began the trip feeling somewhat lost and unsure, but in the process I had managed to find out something of myself. And I knew that at last, I was ready to go home.
