At the end of 2023, I was incredibly fortunate to make a trip down to Chilean Patagonia, where I spent eight days hiking the 'O' circuit in Torres del Paine National Park.
The trail circles the Paine massif, first on a more isolated trail north of the mountains, before joining up with the more popular ‘W’ trail to see the eponymous towers.

I first learned of the 'O' and 'W' from fellow travelers while staying at a hostel in Santiago earlier that year, so when I had the opportunity to return to Chile, I knew I had to work one of these hikes into my itinerary. And I'm so glad I was able to take the time to experience what must surely be one of the most beautiful places on Earth.

I traveled to Patagonia from Boston, crossing over 90 degrees of latitude, trading the frigid northeast winter for the bright summer days that never seemed to end. I spent a few days in Puerto Natales before the hike - this sleepy town perched on a fjord, cut off from the rest of Chile by mountains and glaciers, surrounded by a rugged and austere landscape, reinforced the feeling that I had in some sense, traveled to the ends of the Earth.

Having left my non-camping provisions at my hostel in Puerto Natales, I boarded a bus, one of many ferrying hundreds of tourists to the national park that morning. Most of them would head west, either on day hikes or the 'W' trek, but only a smaller fraction of us would head north to do the full 'O' circuit, limited by the number of people allowed to cross the mountain pass separating the two halves of the park.

Our route began following the Río Paine, a gentle path along the eastern foothills of the massif. Sheltered from the Patagonian winds, the area is lush and green, with bushes sparkling with wildflowers and calafate berries, and still used for grazing. At one point, I had to step off the trail as a herd of horses galloped past me, spurred on by their gauchos.

The open landscape meant that it was easy for me to see the progress I was making, just by looking back and seeing how far down the mountain range I had come. At the same time, every twist and turn, every slope, revealed a new view, of jagged peaks and the meandering river.

Unlike other backcountry hikes I've done in the U.S., in Torres del Paine one is required to stay at specific sites, with no camping permitted outside these areas. I stayed mostly in pre-pitched tents, which while expensive meant that I did not have to carry my own shelter; just a sleeping bag, food, and clothing layers. Having running water and even showers at most of the campsites was also a nice plus.

Dickson campsite, where I stayed on the second night of the hike, was probably the most beautiful camp location. I spent some time on the pebble beach, looking across the lake toward Dickson glacier, now retreated over the border into Argentina. I sat listening to the gentle waves and sweet birdsong, watching the mountains as their peaks popped in and out of the clouds, and snow being blown off their slopes by the occassional wind gust.

Having eight long days to cover the roughly 85-mile distance of the 'O' circuit, especially with the relatively moderate elevation changes, meant that I could take a fairly leisurely pace with hiking. I frequently took long stops to just sit and take in the majestic views, immersing myself in the sublime.

There was also plenty of time to relax at each campsite, especially without the burden of having to make and strike camp each day. Because everyone on the 'O' section of the trail is heading in the same direction and staying at the same campsites, it was easy to build a sense of camaraderie and even friendship. And I suppose that it takes a certain kind of person to be able and willing to travel to the tip of South America, which meant we had a surpsing amount in common to chat about.

The most challenging - both physically and weather-wise - segment of the 'O' circuit is undoubtedly crossing the John Gardner Pass. I was fortunate to have good conditions for almost the entire time I was on the trail, but the day I was to go over the pass was forecast for rain, snow, and 40 mile per hour winds, but not quite bad enough for the rangers to close the pass.

After an early start out of Los Perros campsite, the trail began first as a muddy and rooty affair through the temperature forest, but at least it was relatively sheltered. Once above the tree line, the winds immediately began blowing, strong enough that the snow was falling essentially horizontally. With the trail snowed out and limited visibility, I simply followed the footsteps of the hikers preceding me. I wondered if this is at all approached what it felt like to be part of an expedition, to be one of the first explorers to witness an unknown vista. I can't begin to imagine how much harder it must have been without the modern equipment and technology I was carrying with me.

Once over the pass, I was rewarded with a view of Grey glacier, overlooking that vast white and blue crevasse field, which I had also seen from a boat a few days earlier. I marveled at the titanic forces of ice and rock that shaped this landscape, while also mourning the clear and rapid retreat this glacier has made over the past decades.

I was struck by the remarkable diversity of landscapes this hike traverses, from the shrubland and forests north of the massif, to the windswept steppe in the south, to the snow and rocks up the mountains. Different sections of the trail reminded me of various places I had been: the jagged snow-capped peaks brought back memories of the Grand Tetons, while the damp forest ahead of the John Gardner Pass wouldn't have been out of place in the Pacific Northwest.

After arriving at the Paine Grande campsite on the fifth day, I took a side trail out to a viewpoint overlooking the brilliantly turquoise Lago Pehoé. Away from most of the hikers on the main trails, with only the birds and butterflies for company, I watched the waves race across the lake with a backdrop of one of the best views of the mountains anywhere in the park.

The 'W' trail gets its name from the spurs it takes up two valleys dividing the mountains. The first, Valle Francés, brought me up to a cloud shrouded viewpoint surrounded by sheer rock walls. The sound of avalanches echoed throughout the valley, and I was occassionally able to spot the snow cascading off the steep slopes.

For my last night in the park, I had been able to secure a tent site at Refugio Chileno, halfway up the Valle Ascensio toward the centerpiece of the park, the Torres del Paine. This meant I wouldn't have to backtrack or climb up the full valley, as those staying at Refugio Central would have to do. Even so, I left my tent before 3 in the morning, having been awoken by the sticks and footsteps of other hikers heading up to the Torres in time for sunrise.

I was fortunate to have perfect weather and clear skies on this final day of the hike. Upon stepping out of my tent, I could almost immediately see the sparkling band of the Milky Way, along with one of the Magellanic clouds, as well as some upside down and unfamiliar constellations. At the top, I was able to find a good spot to sit while waiting for sunrise, reunited with some fellow hikers from the 'O'.

As the sun came up, the red early morning light began to dance across the tips of the snow-dusted towers. I watched as those rays illuminated one tower after another, occassionally fading out either because of the background topography or the scattered clouds floating by. Eventually, red turned to yellow, and the landscape was lit up more fully, revealing the surroundings in all their splendor. I was glad to have this finale to a long and amazing adventure.

The hike down the valley and out of the park was a straightfoward one, and as I waited for the bus that would take me back to Puerto Natales, I watched as a new group of fresh-faced hikers embarked on their own adventures. While I was tired and eager for a hot shower, I also felt more relaxed than I'd been in a while. Taking the full eight days to complete the 'O' circuit was the right choice for me: it gave me the time to take in all the beauty around me, and the fewer number of people on the first half of the trail made me feel like I could really get lost in this landscape.

I read several books while on the trail, including one about Ferdinand Magellan's circumnavigation of the globe, which took him past Tierra del Fuego through the strait that now bears his name. While his motives were distasteful and many of the actions made by him and his crew were cruel, I still thought about the wonder they must have felt when encountering this land for the first time, and the fortitute they had to brave it.

The world's a much smaller place today - even though I generally try to avoid seeing photographs of the places I'm visiting beforehand, it was inevitable while planning that I had a preview of the trail. Still, as with most places of such immense scale, photos capture but a sliver of what it's actually like to be immersed in a land and experience it with all your senses. Perhaps all who come to a place like this share a certain kinship, whether they arrived by horse, galleon, or jet plane.

After a little over two weeks in one of the most remote corners of the world, it was finally time to return home. The flight back to Santiago took us over the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, and I watched the flowing glaciers and snaking fjords pass under us, each likely just as beautiful as the ones I had seen over the past days, but even more remote and desolate. Maybe some of these valleys, only recently uncovered by receding glaciers, have never been trod on by human feet. Just as well - while I feel incredibly lucky to have had the resources and infrastructure to hike Torres del Paine, I'm also glad that there are still places that remain untouched, with a beauty that exists even without a beholder.
