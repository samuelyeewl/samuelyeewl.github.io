At the end of 2023, I was incredibly fortunate to make a trip down to Chilean Patagonia, where I spent eight days hiking the 'O' circuit in Torres del Paine National Park.
This roughly 85 mile hike takes you on a route circling the Paine massif, first on a more isolated trail in the north of the park, before joining up with the more popular 'W' hike to see the titular towers.
