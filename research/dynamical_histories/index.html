  <article class="post-content Dynamical Histories of Planetary Systems clearfix">
    <p>Early astronomers saw our solar system as a clockwork mechanism – planets orbiting the sun, moons orbiting the planets, forever and unchanging. But we have since learned that things are more complicated than that. In our Solar System, the orbits of the planets are thought to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_tack_hypothesis">migrated over long distances</a>, while our own moon is thought to have formed as a result of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant-impact_hypothesis">giant impact</a> between a Mars-sized object and the Earth. And as the Sun ages and turns into a red giant, the inner planets (including possibly the Earth), will eventually be engulfed. Our Solar System is a dynamic and sometimes violent place. What can we learn about the history of other planetary systems?</p>

<p>One fascinating planet I studied is the hot Jupiter WASP-12b. Building on a decade of data, particularly those compiled by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06582">Patra et al. (2017)</a>, and adding new observations from <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/main/index.html">NASA’s <em>Spitzer</em> Space Telescope</a>, we found the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09131">decisive evidence</a> showing that the orbit of this planet is decaying, and it will spiral into its star and be destroyed in just a few million years! See press coverage from <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/01/07/planet-wasp-12b-death-spiral-say-scientists">Princeton</a> and <a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/space/exoplanet-dark-wasp12b-death/">Popular Science</a> for more details.</p>

<figure class="full ">
	<img src="/assets/img/oc_diagram_mod.png" />
	
		<figcaption>We obtained new transit and secondary eclipse times of the planet WASP-12b (black squares) and showed that the apparent variation in those times can be attributed to a slow shrinking of the planet's orbit (blue line) rather than apsidal precession of a slightly eccentric orbit (red).</figcaption>
	
</figure>

<p>Apart from hot Jupiters, another type of planetary system we have discovered that are quite different from our own contain many planets on relatively short, tightly-packed orbits. Typically, these planets are slightly bigger than the Earth (we call them super-Earths and sub-Neptunes), and a planetary system may have three or more such planets all orbiting closer to their star than the Earth is to the Sun. One hypothesis that had been put forward is that these systems may have been sculpted by constant gravitational interactions leading to chaos and instability. Working with <a href="https://dtamayo.github.io/">Dan Tamayo</a> and <a href="http://shadden.github.io/">Sam Hadden</a>, we showed that this cannot have been the only process at work, and some dissipiation must have taken place to reduce these planets’ eccentricities and inclinations (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06338">Yee et al. (2021a)</a>).</p>

<figure class="50% ">
	<img src="/assets/img/ttv_stability.png" />
	
		<figcaption>We analyzed the planetary systems discovered by the Kepler mission that showed transit-timing variations (TTVs). The measured eccentricities in these systems are all significantly lower than the limits placed on them by stability, suggesting they must have been damped by some dissipative process.</figcaption>
